# 🚀 Assignment 1 – Data Structures and Algorithms

**Name:** Shushmita Paul  
**Student ID:** 23189444  
**Course:** Data Structures and Algorithms  
**IDE:** NetBeans  

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates key Java concepts including data structures, algorithms, and multithreading. It includes:

- ✅ Custom **LinkedList**, **Stack**, and **Queue**
- 🧪 A **Palindrome Checker**
- 🐍 A simple **Snake Game** using linked lists
- ⛴️ A **Multithreaded Ship-Island Simulation** with GUI

---

## 🧩 Project Components

### 1. Palindrome Checker
Uses custom `Node`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`, and `Queue` classes to test whether a string is a palindrome.

### 2. Snake Game
- Snake grows by collecting letters (stored alphabetically)
- Colliding with numbers causes the snake to drop a letter
- GUI for snake movement and item interaction

### 3. Ship-Island Simulation
- 20+ ships as threads attempting to access a port
- Two modes:
  - 🧨 **Unsynchronized** (race conditions and crashes)
  - 🔐 **Synchronized** (safe, controlled access)
- GUI to visualize ship behavior and detect crashes

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the project in **NetBeans**
2. Go to `Run > Clean and Build Project`
3. Run from NetBeans or open `dist/Assignment1.jar`

## ⚠️ Notes

- This is an individual submission in accordance with AUT’s academic integrity policies.
- GUIs for the Snake Game and Ship Simulation were designed manually.
- All components have been tested across different input scenarios.
